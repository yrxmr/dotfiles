When I was bored and redid Linux's UI

"config" I3 window manager's config file

"dunstrc.md" Dunst's config file (for notifications)

"fetch.sh" Fetch script

"I3blocks.conf.md" I3block's config file (for the task bar)

"Kitty.conf.md" Terminal emulator's config file

"Picom.conf.md" Picom compositor's config file 


All files must be placed in ~/.config
